Octopus Hearts: Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When they swim, the heart delivering blood to the body actually stops.

Banana's Radioactivity: Bananas are slightly radioactive because they contain potassium-40, a radioactive isotope of potassium. But don’t worry, it’s perfectly safe to eat them!

The Sun's Age: The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old, and it’s halfway through its life cycle. Eventually, it will become a red giant and then shrink into a white dwarf.

Longest Word: The longest word in the English language is technically the chemical name of the protein titin, with over 189,000 letters. Saying it out loud would take hours!

Sharks' Ancestors: Sharks are older than trees! Sharks have been around for over 400 million years, whereas the first trees appeared around 350 million years ago.

Butterflies Taste With Their Feet: Butterflies have taste sensors on their feet, allowing them to identify whether the surface they land on is a good spot for laying eggs.

The World's Deepest Hole: The Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia is the deepest hole ever dug by humans, reaching a depth of over 12 kilometers. It took nearly 20 years to drill that deep!

A Year on Venus: A day on Venus (a full rotation) is longer than a year on Venus because it rotates on its axis very slowly compared to its orbit around the Sun.

Jellyfish Immortality: Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the “immortal jellyfish,” can revert its cells back to their earliest form, potentially avoiding natural death indefinitely.

Penguins Propose: Male gentoo penguins propose to their mates by presenting them with a perfect pebble. If the female accepts, they use the pebble to build their nest together.
